    "You are given an m x n grid with obstacles (1) and empty cells (0), plus an integer k representing the maximum number of obstacles you can eliminate. Return the minimum number of steps to move from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1) with at most k eliminations, or -1 if impossible."

    "- Hint 1: Encode the state as `(row, col, remaining_eliminations)`.\n",
    "- Hint 2: Keep a best-remaining-k record per cell so you do not revisit it with an inferior budget.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Early exit once you reach the bottom-right corner; BFS guarantees it is optimal.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "This is a shortest-path problem on an implicit graph whose nodes store both a grid location and how many obstacles can still be removed. Run BFS starting from `(0, 0, k)`. When expanding to a neighbor containing a `1`, consume one elimination. If the new state improves the remaining budget recorded for that cell, push it into the queue. The first time we poll `(m-1, n-1)` we have found the shortest path length.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Handle the trivial case `m == 1` and `n == 1` by returning 0.\n",
    "2. If `k` is large enough to bypass every obstacle along the Manhattan path (`k >= m + n - 2`), return that distance directly.\n",
    "3. Initialize a queue with `(0, 0, k)` and a `visited` matrix that stores the best remaining budget seen for each cell (initialize to `-1`).\n",
    "4. While the queue is non-empty:\n",
    "   - For the current BFS level, iterate over all states.\n",
    "   - When popping `(r, c, remaining)`, return the steps if `(r, c)` is the target.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, iterate the four directional moves; compute `(nr, nc)` and the new budget `nk = remaining - grid[nr][nc]`.\n",
    "   - Skip invalid coordinates or states where `nk < 0` or `visited[nr][nc] >= nk`.\n",
    "   - Update `visited[nr][nc] = nk` and enqueue `(nr, nc, nk)`.\n",
    "5. Increase the step counter after processing one level.\n",
    "6. Return `-1` if the queue empties without reaching the target.\n"
