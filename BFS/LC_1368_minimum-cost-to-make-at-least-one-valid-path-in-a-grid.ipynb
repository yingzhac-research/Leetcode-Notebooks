    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Interpret the grid as a directed graph. From each cell you can move up, down, left, or right. Continuing along the cell's prescribed arrow incurs no additional cost, whereas changing direction adds 1. Apply 0-1 BFS: keep a deque, pop from the left, and push neighbors to the front for zero-cost transitions or to the back for cost-one transitions. Update the distance table whenever a cheaper cost is found.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Map directions: `1` → right, `2` → left, `3` → down, `4` → up.\n",
    "2. Initialize `dist` with `inf` and set `dist[0][0] = 0`; enqueue `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "3. While the deque is not empty, pop `(r, c)`.\n",
    "4. For each of the four directions, compute `(nr, nc)` and the associated cost (`0` if the index matches `grid[r][c]`, else `1`).\n",
    "5. If the new cost `dist[r][c] + cost` is smaller than `dist[nr][nc]`, update it.\n",
    "6. Push `(nr, nc)` to the front when `cost == 0`, otherwise push to the back.\n",
    "7. Continue until the deque empties; the answer is `dist[m-1][n-1]`.\n"
