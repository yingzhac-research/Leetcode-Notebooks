    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Compute outdegrees for all nodes and build a reverse adjacency list. Initialize a queue with nodes whose outdegree is zero. Pop nodes, mark them safe, and decrement the outdegree of their predecessors. When a predecessor's outdegree becomes zero, enqueue it. The nodes processed by this reverse BFS are the eventual safe states.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Let `n` be the number of nodes. Create `outdeg[i] = len(graph[i])` and `reverse[v]` as a list of predecessors.\n",
    "2. Populate a queue with all nodes where `outdeg[i] == 0`.\n",
    "3. Maintain a boolean array `safe` initialized to `False`.\n",
    "4. While the queue has nodes:\n",
    "   - Pop `u`; mark `safe[u] = True`.\n",
    "   - For each predecessor `p` in `reverse[u]`, decrement `outdeg[p]`.\n",
    "   - If `outdeg[p]` becomes zero, enqueue `p`.\n",
    "5. After BFS, collect all indices `i` where `safe[i]` holds, sort them, and return.\n"
