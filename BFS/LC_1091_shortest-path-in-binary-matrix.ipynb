    "Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path from top-left to bottom-right. A path is clear if all visited cells are 0 and moves can be made in 8 directions. Return -1 if no such path exists."

    "- Hint 1: Treat each cell as a node with up to eight neighbors—diagonals included.\n",
    "- Hint 2: Push `(row, col, distance)` triples into the queue so you know how many steps have elapsed when you reach the target.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Mark cells as visited the moment they enter the queue to avoid revisiting them from longer paths.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Run BFS starting from `(0, 0)` when both the start and end cells are clear. At every dequeue operation, expand the eight surrounding offsets. Skip coordinates that fall outside the grid, are blocked by a `1`, or were already visited. The first time you pop the bottom-right corner, the associated distance is the length of the shortest clear path. If the queue empties first, no path exists and the answer is `-1`.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Guard: if either the start or end cell is `1`, return `-1` immediately.\n",
    "2. Initialize a queue with `(0, 0, 1)` where the last component holds the path length so far.\n",
    "3. Maintain an `n × n` boolean grid for visited flags; mark `(0, 0)` as visited before enqueuing.\n",
    "4. While the queue is non-empty, pop the front triple `(r, c, dist)`.\n",
    "5. If `(r, c)` equals `(n-1, n-1)`, return `dist` because BFS guarantees minimal steps.\n",
    "6. For each of the eight directional deltas, compute `(nr, nc)`; when inside bounds, unvisited, and `grid[nr][nc] == 0`, mark visited and enqueue `(nr, nc, dist + 1)`.\n",
    "7. If the loop finishes without reaching the target, return `-1`.\n"
