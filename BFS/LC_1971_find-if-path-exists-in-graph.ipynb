    "- Hint 1: Build an adjacency list from the edge list; the graph is undirected.\n",

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Construct the adjacency list and run BFS from `source`. Pop nodes from the queue, enqueue their neighbors when unseen, and return `True` as soon as `destination` is popped (or discovered). If BFS completes without finding the destination, return `False`. DFS provides the same complexity but BFS avoids recursion depth concerns.\n"

    "   - Iterate neighbors `v` in `graph[u]`; if unseen, mark visited and enqueue.\n",
