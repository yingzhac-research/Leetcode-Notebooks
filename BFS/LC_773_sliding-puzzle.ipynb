    "You are given a 2x3 board containing numbers 1..5 and a blank represented by 0. In one move, you can swap the blank with an adjacent number. Return the least number of moves needed to reach the target configuration `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]`, or -1 if impossible."

    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Hint 1: Represent the board as a string (e.g., `'123450'`) so swaps become easy.\n",
    "- Hint 2: Precompute which indices can swap with the zero position to avoid recalculating neighbors.\n",
    "- Hint 3: BFS explores configurations by depth; stop when the target `'123450'` is dequeued.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Serialize the 2×3 board into a six-character string. Use BFS where each state swaps the `'0'` tile with its legal neighbors. Maintain a visited set of strings. The first time we pop the target configuration we return the number of moves taken. If no solution exists, BFS exhausts all reachable states and returns `-1`.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Convert the starting board into a string.\n",
    "2. Define adjacency for each index of `'0'`: `[ (1,3), (0,2,4), (1,5), (0,4), (1,3,5), (2,4) ]`.\n",
    "3. Initialize a queue with the starting state and depth 0; mark it visited.\n",
    "4. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Pop `(state, depth)`.\n",
    "   - If `state == target`, return `depth`.\n",
    "   - Find the index of `'0'`; for each neighbor index, swap to produce a new string.\n",
    "   - If unseen, enqueue `(new_state, depth + 1)` and mark visited.\n",
    "5. If the queue empties, return `-1` (the puzzle is unsolvable from this configuration).\n"
