    "Use BFS over stopping positions. From each cell, attempt to roll in four directions, moving until the next step hits a wall or boundary. Step back to the last valid position and enqueue it if unseen. Continue until you either dequeue the destination (return `True`) or exhaust the queue (return `False`).\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Initialize a queue with the start position and mark it visited.\n",
    "2. While the queue is non-empty:\n",
    "   - Pop `(r, c)`; if it equals the destination, return `True`.\n",
    "   - For each direction `(dr, dc)` in up/down/left/right:\n",
    "     - Set `(nr, nc) = (r, c)` and roll while the next cell is within bounds and empty.\n",
    "     - After the loop, step back one cell to the last valid position.\n",
    "     - If that stop cell has not been visited, mark visited and enqueue it.\n",
    "3. If BFS completes without reaching the destination, return `False`.\n"
