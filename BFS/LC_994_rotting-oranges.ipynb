    "You are given an m x n grid where each cell can be 0 (empty), 1 (fresh orange), or 2 (rotten orange). Every minute, fresh oranges adjacent (4-directionally) to rotten ones become rotten. Return the minimum time needed for all oranges to rot, or -1 if impossible."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Enqueue all rotten oranges with timestamp 0 and count the total number of fresh oranges. Each BFS layer represents one minute. When popping a rotten orange, infect its four neighbors if they are fresh, decrementing the fresh counter. Keep track of the last minute processed. After BFS finishes, if no fresh oranges remain, return the elapsed minutes; otherwise, `-1`.\n"

    "2. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Pop `(r, c, minute)` and update `answer = max(answer, minute)`.\n",
    "   - For each of the four neighbors `(nr, nc)`, if the cell is fresh, convert it to rotten, decrement the fresh counter, and enqueue `(nr, nc, minute + 1)`.\n",
    "3. After BFS, if `fresh` is zero, return `answer`; otherwise return `-1`.\n"
