    "## Problem Statement 原题描述\n",
    "Given two words `beginWord` and `endWord` plus a dictionary `wordList`, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`. Each step may change exactly one letter and the intermediate word must appear in `wordList`. Return `0` if the transformation is impossible.\n"

    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Hint 1: Think of each word as a node; edges connect words that differ by one character.\n",
    "- Hint 2: Pre-computing generic patterns such as `h*t` helps you find neighbors quickly.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Meet in the middle with bi-directional BFS to cut the branching factor down.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Use bidirectional BFS: start one frontier from `beginWord` and the other from `endWord`. At each round, expand the smaller frontier by replacing every letter with `a..z`, forming candidate words. When a candidate appears in the opposite frontier we have connected the two searches; the depth is the ladder length. Removing used words from the dictionary prevents revisits.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Load `wordList` into a hash set for `O(1)` lookups; immediately return `0` if `endWord` is absent.\n",
    "2. Initialize `front` with `beginWord` and `back` with `endWord`; keep a `level` counter starting at 1.\n",
    "3. Always expand the smaller frontier to limit the branching factor.\n",
    "4. For each word in the frontier, iterate each character position and substitute letters `a..z` to generate neighbors.\n",
    "5. If a neighbor exists in the opposite frontier we have connected the ladders; return `level + 1`.\n",
    "6. Otherwise, add unseen neighbors to the next frontier and remove them from the dictionary to avoid revisits.\n",
    "7. When the frontier empties without meeting the other side, no path exists and the answer is `0`.\n"
