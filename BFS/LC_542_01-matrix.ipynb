    "Seed a queue with all zero-valued cells and set their distance to zero. For each dequeued cell `(r, c)`, inspect its four neighbors. If the neighbor's current distance exceeds `dist[r][c] + 1`, update it and enqueue the neighbor. BFS guarantees the first distance assigned is minimal because all edges have unweighted cost 1.\n"
