    "You are given a binary matrix isWater, where 1 represents water and 0 land. Assign each cell a height following: water cells have height 0, adjacent cells (4-directionally) must differ by at most 1, and heights should be non-negative. Return any height assignment that maximizes the highest peak."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Treat every water cell as a distance-zero source. Run multi-source BFS: enqueue all water coordinates with height 0, then expand in four directions. Whenever you reach an unassigned land cell, set its height to the parent height plus one and enqueue it. BFS ensures that the first time we assign a cell we use the smallest possible height.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Let `height` be an `m × n` array initialized with `-1`.\n",
    "2. Push all water cells `(r, c)` with height 0 into the queue and set `height[r][c] = 0`.\n",
    "3. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Pop `(r, c)`.\n",
    "   - For each of the four directions, compute `(nr, nc)`.\n",
    "   - If `(nr, nc)` is inside the grid and `height[nr][nc] == -1`, set `height[nr][nc] = height[r][c] + 1` and enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n",
    "4. Continue until the queue empties; all land cells will have the minimum distance to the nearest water source.\n",
    "5. Return `height`.\n"
