    "## Problem Statement 原题描述\n",
    "You have a lock represented by a 4-digit string. You can turn each wheel forward or backward by one (with wrap-around). Given a set of deadends and a target combination, find the minimum number of turns to open the lock from \"0000\", or return -1 if impossible."

    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Hint 1: Each lock state is a four-digit string; neighbors are reached by incrementing or decrementing one digit mod 10.\n",
    "- Hint 2: Avoid deadend states by storing them in a `blocked` set.\n",
    "- Hint 3: BFS layers correspond to rotations performed; stop when the target state is dequeued.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Use BFS starting from `'0000'` provided it is not blocked. For each state, generate up to eight neighbors by adjusting each digit ±1 modulo 10. Enqueue unseen states that are not in the deadend set. The level at which you discover the target yields the minimal number of turns; if BFS exhausts without reaching it, return `-1`.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Convert `deadends` into a set for `O(1)` membership checks. If `'0000'` is blocked, return `-1`.\n",
    "2. Initialize a queue with `'0000'` and a visited set containing it.\n",
    "3. Set `depth = 0`. While the queue has nodes:\n",
    "   - For all states in the current level, pop a state `code`.\n",
    "   - If `code == target`, return `depth`.\n",
    "   - For each of four positions, rotate forward and backward modulo 10 to form neighbors.\n",
    "   - Enqueue any neighbor absent from `blocked` and `visited`, marking it visited immediately.\n",
    "   - After processing the level, increment `depth`.\n",
    "4. If the queue empties, return `-1`.\n"
