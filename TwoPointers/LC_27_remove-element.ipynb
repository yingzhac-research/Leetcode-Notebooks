Return the number of elements in nums that are not equal to val. The first k elements of nums should contain the result; values beyond k can be arbitrary.\n"

   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Initialize write = 0.\n2. Loop read from0 to n-\n1. If nums[read] != val, assign nums[write] = nums[read] and increment write.\n3. At the end, write equals the number of retained values, and the prefix nums[:write] stores all values not equal to val in their original relative order.\n4. Any entries after write may keep old data; they lie outside the retained segment.\n"
