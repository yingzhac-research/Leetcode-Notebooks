Merge nums2 into nums1 in-place so that the final array is sorted and return nothing.\n"

   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Set write = m + n - 1, i = m - 1, j = n - 1.\n2. While both i and j are valid, place the larger of nums1[i] and nums2[j] at nums1[write] and decrement the corresponding pointer and write.\n3. If nums2 has remaining elements, copy them into nums1 at the front; any remaining nums1 elements are already in place.\n4. The final nums1 is sorted because we always place the next largest remaining element at the back.\n"
