You have two baskets and each basket can hold any quantity of a single type of fruit, but you can only pick one fruit per tree. Starting from any tree, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot pick anymore. Return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.\n"

   "source": "## Progressive Hints\n- **Hint1**: The problem reduces to finding the longest subarray with at most two distinct values.\n- **Hint2**: Use a sliding window tracking counts of fruit types.\n- **Hint3**: When more than two types are present, shrink from the left.\n"
