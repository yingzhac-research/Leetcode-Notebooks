    "1. Sort `nums` to bring equal values together and enable the two-pointer technique.\n",
    "2. Loop through each index `i` up to `len(nums) - 3`, treating `nums[i]` as the first element of a potential triplet. Skip `i` if it repeats the previous value to prevent duplicate triplets.\n",
    "3. For each `i`, initialize two pointers: `left = i + 1` and `right = len(nums) - 1`.\n",
    "4. Compute the current sum: `current = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.\n",
    "   - If `current == 0`, add the triplet to the result, then move both pointers inward while skipping duplicates.\n",
    "   - If `current < 0`, increment `left` to increase the sum.\n",
    "   - If `current > 0`, decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n",
    "5. Continue until `left` and `right` cross.\n",
    "6. Collect all unique triplets found during the process."
