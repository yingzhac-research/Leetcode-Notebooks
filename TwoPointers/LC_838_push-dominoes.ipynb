    "2. Scan from right to left, recording the steps to the nearest 'L' to build the left_forces array.\n",
    "3. For each index, compare the two forces: if neither exists, keep '.'; if only one exists, fall toward it; if both exist, the smaller distance wins and a tie leaves the domino upright.\n",
