    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Precompute the frequency of each character in t and a counter of how many unique characters are satisfied in the current window.\n",
    "2. Expand the right pointer, adding characters to the window count. When a character's count matches the requirement, increment a formed counter.\n",
    "3. While formed equals the number of unique required characters, attempt to shrink the window by moving left, updating the best answer when the window length is smaller.\n",
    "4. When a required character count falls below the needed amount, stop shrinking and continue expanding."
