Converting the i-th character of s to the i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| in ASCII. Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be equal to the corresponding substring of t with a total conversion cost less than or equal to maxCost.\n"

   "source": "## Progressive Hints\n- **Hint1**: The cost function is additive, so use a sliding window with running cost.\n- **Hint2**: Expand the window while total cost <= maxCost.\n- **Hint3**: Shrink from left when cost exceeds budget.\n"
