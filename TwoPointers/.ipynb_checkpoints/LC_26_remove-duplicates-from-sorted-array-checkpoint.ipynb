The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Because it is impossible to change the length of the array in place, you must place the result in the first part of the array nums. Return the number of unique elements k. Consider the first k slots of nums as the final result; the values beyond k can be ignored."

Whenever nums[fast] differs from nums[slow], increment slow and copy nums[fast] to nums[slow], extending the unique prefix.\n3. After the scan, the first slow+1 positions store all unique elements in order and slow+1 is the answer k.\n4. The tail of the array remains untouched but is outside the required region, so we leave it as is."
