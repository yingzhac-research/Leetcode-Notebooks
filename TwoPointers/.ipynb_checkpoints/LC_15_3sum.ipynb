Loop through each index `i` up to `len(nums) - 3`, treating `nums[i]` as the first element of a potential triplet. Skip `i` if it repeats the previous value to prevent duplicate triplets.\n3. For each `i`, initialize two pointers: `left = i + 1` and `right = len(nums) - 1`.\n4. Compute the current sum: `current = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.\n   - If `current == 0`, add the triplet to the result, then move both pointers inward while skipping duplicates.\n   - If `current < 0`, increment `left` to increase the sum.\n   - If `current > 0`, decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n5. Continue until `left` and `right` cross.\n6. Collect all unique triplets found during the process."
