      "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Maintain left and right pointers at the ends alongside left_max and right_max.\n2. At every step, compare height[left] and height[right]. The smaller side determines the water level; accumulate left_max - height[left] or right_max - height[right] if positive.\n3. Update the corresponding pointer and running maximum, then continue until the pointers cross.\n4. This works because any bar processed is bounded by a known taller border on the processed side and possibly a taller bar on the opposite side."
