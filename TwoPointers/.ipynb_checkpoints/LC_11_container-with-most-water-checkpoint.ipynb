There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water. Return the maximum area of water the container can store."

At each step compute width=right-left and area=width*min(height[left], height[right]).\n3. Update the best area so far. To find a potentially larger area, move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, because increasing height is the only way to compensate for the shrinking width.\n4. Continue until the pointers cross. This strategy leverages the fact that moving the taller line cannot improve the area if the shorter one remains the bottleneck."
