    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between balls. You are given an integer array `position` representing valid positions to place balls. You are also given an integer `m`, the number of balls to place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the balls in the positions such that the minimum pairwise distance between balls is maximized. Return the maximum possible value of this minimum distance.\n",
    "\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Sort the positions first to reason about gaps.\n",
    "- Binary search the candidate minimum distance.\n",
    "- A greedy placement from left to right can test feasibility for a given distance.\n"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "After sorting positions, the feasibility of placing balls with minimum distance `d` is monotonic. Use binary search on `d` and greedily place balls while the distance constraint holds.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Sort `position` in ascending order.\n",
    "2. Binary search on `d` within `[1, position[-1] - position[0]]`.\n",
    "3. For a candidate `d`, place the first ball at `position[0]` and greedily attempt to place subsequent balls whenever the gap from the last placed ball is at least `d`.\n",
    "4. If at least `m` balls can be placed, record feasibility and move the lower bound up; otherwise decrease the distance.\n",
    "5. Continue until the largest feasible `d` remains.\n"
