    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers`. The `i`-th player has a skill level `players[i]`, and the `j`-th trainer has a training capacity `trainers[j]`. A player can be matched to a trainer only if the trainer's capacity is greater than or equal to the player's skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign each trainer to at most one player and each player to at most one trainer. Return the maximum number of matchings you can achieve.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Sort both arrays so that trainers and players can be processed in ascending order.\n",
    "- Reuse `bisect_left` with a moving lower bound to locate the first trainer that can handle the current player.\n",
    "- Advance the lower bound after every assignment to ensure each trainer is used at most once.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "After sorting players and trainers, iterate through the players in ascending skill. For each player, binary search the trainer list starting from the first unused index to find the earliest trainer whose capacity is sufficient. If one exists, record a match and advance the starting index so future searches consider only unused trainers.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Sort `players` and `trainers` independently in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "2. Maintain a pointer `start` that marks the first trainer index that has not yet been assigned.\n",
    "3. For each player skill, call `bisect_left(trainers, skill, lo=start)` to find the first trainer who can cover that skill.\n",
    "4. If the search returns a valid index inside the array, increment the match counter and set `start = index + 1` so that trainer cannot be reused.\n",
    "5. If no trainer is available, skip the player; all remaining players require at least as much skill, so the loop can finish early.\n",
    "6. Return the accumulated match count.\n"
