    "A conveyor belt has packages with weights `weights[i]`. Each day you load the packages in their original order. The load cannot exceed the ship capacity. Find the minimum capacity of the ship so that all packages can be shipped within `days` days.\n",

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Set `left = max(weights)` to ensure any package fits, and `right = sum(weights)` as the upper bound.\n",
    "2. For a candidate capacity `mid`, traverse the packages while accumulating the current day's load.\n",
    "3. When the load would exceed `mid`, start a new day counter and reset the load.\n",
    "4. If the days used exceed `days`, increase capacity by setting `left = mid + 1`; otherwise reduce `right = mid`.\n",
    "5. Return the converged capacity.\n"
