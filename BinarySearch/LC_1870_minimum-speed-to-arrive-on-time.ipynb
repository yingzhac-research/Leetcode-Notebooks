    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "You are given an integer array `dist` representing distances to travel for consecutive train rides and a floating point number `hour` representing the total time limit. For all rides except the last one, you must depart at an integer hour, so each intermediate ride takes `ceil(dist[i] / speed)` hours. The last ride can finish at a fractional hour `dist[-1] / speed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum integer speed that allows completion of all rides within `hour`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Binary search the speed between `1` and a sufficiently large upper bound such as `10^7`.\n",
    "- At each step compute the travel time by ceiling all but the final leg.\n",
    "- Check impossibility early: if `hour` <= len(dist) - 1, no solution exists.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Travel time strictly decreases with higher speeds, so binary search the minimal integer speed that satisfies the timetable constraint, combining integer ceilings with a fractional final leg.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. If `hour` is less than `len(dist) - 1`, immediate failure because the integer departures already exceed the limit.\n",
    "2. Binary search over speed with bounds `[1, 10**7]`, which suffices because `10**7` is the maximum needed per constraints.\n",
    "3. For a candidate speed, sum the travel time by ceiling division for each leg except the last, then add the fractional time of the final leg.\n",
    "4. If the total time is greater than `hour`, increase the speed; otherwise lower it.\n",
    "5. Return the first speed that meets the limit, or `-1` if even the upper bound fails.\n"
