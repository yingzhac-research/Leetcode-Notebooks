    "There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi before course ai. Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Build an adjacency list from prerequisites. For each node, run DFS with a color/state array: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited. When exploring a node, mark it visiting. If a neighbor is already visiting, a cycle exists. Once all neighbors finish, mark the node visited. The graph is acyclic if all DFS traversals complete without finding a back edge."

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Build adjacency list graph of size numCourses.\n",
    "2. Initialize state array of length numCourses to 0.\n",
    "3. For each course, invoke dfs(i). If dfs returns False (cycle found), stop and return False.\n",
    "4. dfs(u) marks state[u] = 1, iterates neighbors v. If state[v] == 1, cycle; if state[v] == 0 and dfs(v) False, propagate failure. After exploring neighbors, set state[u] = 2 and return True.\n",
