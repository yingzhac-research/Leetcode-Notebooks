    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Hint 1: A path may turn at most once; it consists of the current node plus the best gains from left and right subtrees.\n",
    "- Hint 2: When returning from recursion, you can only pass one side upward because a parent path cannot split.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Clamp negative gains to zero so they do not decrease the path sum.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Use post-order DFS. For each node compute the best downward path sum we can contribute to its parent (`gain`). Simultaneously track a global answer that considers `node.val + left_gain + right_gain` as a candidate best path going through the node. The returned gain is `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain, 0)`.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Initialize `best = -inf` to store the global maximum path sum.\n",
    "2. Define a recursive helper `dfs(node)` that returns the maximum gain from this node down to leaves.\n",
    "3. Recursively compute `left_gain = max(dfs(node.left), 0)` and `right_gain = max(dfs(node.right), 0)`.\n",
    "4. Update `best = max(best, node.val + left_gain + right_gain)` to capture the highest split path passing through `node`.\n",
    "5. Return `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)` so the parent can extend only one side.\n",
    "6. After traversing the entire tree, `best` holds the answer.\n"
