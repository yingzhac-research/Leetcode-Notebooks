        "Sort candidates to allow early pruning. DFS keeps track of the current index and remaining target. For each index, we decide either to include the candidate (and stay on the same index to allow reuse) or skip to the next index. Whenever the remainder hits zero, we record the path. Recursive unwinding ensures all valid combinations are found without duplicates."

        "3. If remainder == 0, append path.copy() to results. If remainder < 0, return immediately (prune).\n",
        "4. Iterate i from start to len(candidates)-1. For each candidates[i], append to path, recurse with dfs(i, remainder - candidates[i], path), then pop.\n",
        "5. Because we never iterate indices less than start, we prevent permutations of the same combination from being added twice.\n",
        "6. Complexity depends on the solution space but pruning reduces exploration compared to brute force."
