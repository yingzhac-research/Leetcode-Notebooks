    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Perform DFS from the entry node. Maintain a dictionary mapping original nodes to their cloned counterparts. When visiting a node, create its clone if necessary, then recursively clone all neighbors, appending the cloned neighbor references. Because the graph is connected, every node will eventually be cloned, and the map prevents cycles from causing infinite recursion."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Handle null input by returning None.\n",
    "2. Use a dictionary `cloned` where `cloned[original] = copy`.\n",
    "3. Define dfs(node) that returns the clone. If node already in cloned, return it. Otherwise, create a new Node with the same value, store it, and DFS all neighbors, appending their clones.\n",
    "4. Because the graph is undirected and finite, recursion completes; complexity is linear in number of nodes plus edges."
