    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Apply Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm. Perform DFS, assigning monotonically increasing timestamps. For each outgoing edge `(u, v)`, recurse on unvisited neighbors, update `low[u]` with `low[v]`, and flag the edge as a bridge if `low[v] > tin[u]`. When the neighbor is already visited and not the parent, update `low[u]` with `tin[v]` to account for back edges.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Build an adjacency list for the undirected graph.\n",
    "2. Maintain arrays `tin` and `low` sized `n`, initialized to `-1` to indicate unvisited nodes, plus a global timer starting at 0.\n",
    "3. For each unvisited node, call `dfs(u, parent)`:\n",
    "   - Set `tin[u] = low[u] = timer` and increment `timer`.\n",
    "   - Iterate neighbors `v`:\n",
    "     - Skip `parent` to avoid immediately retracing the tree edge.\n",
    "     - If `tin[v] == -1`, recurse `dfs(v, u)`, then update `low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])`. If `low[v] > tin[u]`, record `(u, v)` as a critical connection.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, update `low[u] = min(low[u], tin[v])` for back edges.\n",
    "4. Collect every edge flagged as critical and return the list.\n"
