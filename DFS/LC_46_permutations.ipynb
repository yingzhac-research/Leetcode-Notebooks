    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Backtracking explores a decision tree where each level chooses one unused number. We maintain a path array representing the current partial permutation and a used flag array. When the path length matches the input size, it forms a full permutation that we record. After exploring a branch we backtrack by unmarking the chosen number."

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty list path and a boolean list used to track whether nums[i] is already in the path.\n",
    "2. Define backtrack() that checks if len(path) == len(nums). If so, append path.copy() to answers.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, iterate through indices. For each unused index i, mark used[i] = True, append nums[i] to path, recurse, then pop and reset used[i] = False.\n",
    "4. The recursion depth is len(nums), and each level fans out to remaining unused numbers, generating n! permutations.\n",
    "5. The runtime is O(n * n!) due to copying lists; memory is O(n) for recursion plus O(n * n!) to store results."
