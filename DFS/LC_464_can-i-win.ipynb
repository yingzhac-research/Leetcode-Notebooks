    "Define dfs(mask, remaining) which returns True if the current player can force a win with the remaining total and already-used numbers encoded in mask. Iterate through numbers 1..max; if a number is unused and reaches remaining or leads to opponent failure, current state wins. Memoize results by mask and remaining to avoid recomputation."

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Handle trivial cases: desiredTotal <= 0 => True; if total sum of range is less than desiredTotal => False.\n",
    "2. Use functools.lru_cache to memoize dfs(mask, remaining).\n",
    "3. For each number i from 1..maxChoosableInteger, if unused (`mask & bit == 0`), check two winning conditions:\n",
    "   - i >= remaining (current player wins immediately).\n",
    "   - dfs(mask | bit, remaining - i) returns False (opponent cannot win).\n",
    "4. If no winning move exists, state is losing. Complexity is limited by 2^max states, with max <= 20."
