    "You are given an integer n and an n x n binary matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 when the i-th city and the j-th city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise. The matrix is symmetric and every city is connected to itself.\n\n",

    "## Progressive Hints\n",
    "- Hint 1: Treat the matrix as an adjacency representation of an undirected graph; each city is a node.\n",
    "- Hint 2: When you visit a city, expand to all neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Count how many DFS launches you need to cover every city; that number is the answer."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Perform depth-first search on the implicit graph given by the adjacency matrix. Maintaining a visited set ensures that each city is explored once. Launching DFS from every unvisited node yields the number of connected components. Alternative approaches include Union Find or BFS, but the DFS recursion is straightforward and matches the matrix size limits."

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Interpret isConnected as an adjacency matrix for an undirected graph of n nodes.\n",
    "2. Maintain a visited boolean array of length n.\n",
    "3. Iterate i from 0 to n-1. If city i has not been visited, increment the province count and run DFS(i).\n",
    "4. DFS(i) marks city i visited, then scans row i of the matrix. For any neighbor j with isConnected[i][j] == 1 and not yet visited, recursively DFS(j).\n",
    "5. Because the graph is undirected, recursion respects symmetry and eventually marks all nodes in the connected component.\n",
    "6. Complexity remains O(n^2) because each matrix entry may be inspected once, matching matrix traversal cost."
