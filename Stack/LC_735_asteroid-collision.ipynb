Collisions occur when a moving right asteroid meets a left-moving asteroid. After all collisions, return the final state.\n",

For each new asteroid, while there is a potential collision (stack top moving right and current moving left), resolve by comparing sizes. Destroy the smaller asteroid, pop equal ones, and only push the current asteroid if it survives.\n"

        "   - If sizes are equal, pop and set `a = 0` to mark destruction.\n",
