        "   - While stack is not empty and `h > height[stack[-1]]`, pop `bottom` from the stack.\n",
        "   - If the stack becomes empty, break because there is no left boundary.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, let `left = stack[-1]`. The width is `i - left - 1`, and the bounded height is `min(height[left], h) - height[bottom]`. Add their product to `water`.\n",
        "   - Push `i` onto the stack.\n",
        "3. After processing all bars, `water` holds the total trapped volume.\n"
