   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Handle `k == 0` by returning 0 immediately.\n2. Initialize `left = 0`, `best = 0`, and `counts = {}`.\n3. For each `right` index, increment the count of `s[right]`.\n4. While the number of keys in `counts` exceeds `k`, decrement `s[left]`, delete it when the count hits zero, and advance `left`.\n5. Update `best` using the current window length.\n6. Continue until the end of the string."
