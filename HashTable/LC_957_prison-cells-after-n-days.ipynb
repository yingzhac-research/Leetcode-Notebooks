    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "There are 8 prison cells in a row, each either occupied (1) or vacant (0). Each day, cells change state according to the following rule: if a cell has two adjacent neighbors in the same state, it becomes occupied; otherwise it becomes vacant. Both ends have a single neighbor outside the array and are always treated as vacant. Given an array cells representing the initial state and an integer n, return the state of the prison after n days.\n"

    "- Hint 2: Encode the interior cells as a bitmask so you can store previously seen states in a hash map.\n",

    "## Solution Overview\n",

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "Because there are only 8 cells and the two edges always become 0 after the first day, the system has at most 2^6 unique states. We can encode the state as an integer bitmask (using only the interior cells) or as a tuple and store it in a dictionary mapping to the day index when it first appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm steps:\n",
    "1. Convert the current cell configuration into a tuple to serve as a hashable key.\n",
    "2. Iterate day by day. For each day, compute the next cell state by checking neighbors.\n",
    "3. If the newly produced state is already in the dictionary, a cycle of length `cycle = current_day - first_seen_day` is found.\n",
    "4. Reduce the remaining steps `remaining = (n - current_day) % cycle` and replay the transition that many times to reach the final state.\n",
    "5. Return the state after all simulated days.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy turns a potentially billion-step simulation into at most a few dozen iterations thanks to cycle detection.\n"
