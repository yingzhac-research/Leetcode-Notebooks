    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Use a hash map to store each value's index while scanning the array once. For each number, compute its complement (`target - value`) and immediately return the pair when the complement has already been seen. This replaces the quadratic pair search with linear time lookup via hashing."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty dictionary `seen` that maps a value to its index.\n",
    "2. Iterate through `nums` with both index and value.\n",
    "3. For each value, compute `complement = target - value` which is the number needed to reach the target.\n",
    "4. If `complement` already exists in `seen`, return the stored index and the current index because together they meet the target.\n",
    "5. Otherwise record the current value and its index in `seen`, then continue scanning.\n",
    "6. Because the problem guarantees one solution, the loop will exit with a successful pair; if defensive programming is needed, raising an exception afterwards signals inconsistent input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leans on constant-time average lookups of a hash table, trading a little extra memory for a large performance gain over the brute-force O(n^2) search."
