    "Given two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a list of words, and a list of pairs of similar words, determine if the two sentences are similar. Two sentences are similar if they have the same length and each pair of corresponding words is either identical or appears as a pair (in either order) in the similarity list. Similarity is not transitive beyond the provided pairs.\n"

    "1. If the sentences differ in length, they cannot be similar.\n",
    "2. Build a dictionary `neighbors` where `neighbors[a]` contains every word paired with `a`.\n",
    "3. For each index i, compare `w1 = sentence1[i]` and `w2 = sentence2[i]`:\n",
    "   - If they are equal, continue.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, check whether `w2` is in `neighbors[w1]`.\n",
    "4. If any mismatch arises, return False. If the loop completes, return True.\n",

    "The mapping provides constant-time checks for direct similarity and respects the non-transitive constraint.\n"
