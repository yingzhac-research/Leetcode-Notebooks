   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Initialize `left = 0`, `best = 0`, and an empty dictionary `last_seen`.\n2. Iterate `right` over the string. For each character, check if it appeared within the current window using `last_seen`.\n3. If the character was seen, update `left` to `max(left, last_seen[char] + 1)` to skip over the previous occurrence.\n4. Update `last_seen[char] = right` and compute the window length `right - left + 1`, updating `best` when larger.\n5. Return `best` after scanning the string."
