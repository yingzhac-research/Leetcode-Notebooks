You have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. You want to pick as many fruits as possible while moving from left to right, picking at most one fruit from each tree. Return the maximum number of fruits you can pick."

   "source": "## Progressive Hints\n- Hint 1: Use a sliding window to represent the range of trees picked.\n- Hint 2: Track fruit counts in the window using a hash map.\n- Hint 3: When more than two types appear, move the left pointer until only two remain."

   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Initialize `left = 0`, `best = 0`, and `counts = {}`.\n2. As `right` progresses, increment the count for `fruits[right]`.\n3. While `counts` contains more than two types, decrement `fruits[left]` and remove it when the count hits zero, then increment `left`.\n4. Update `best` with the window length `right - left + 1`.\n5. Return `best` after reaching the end."
