Return all starting indices of substrings in `s` that are a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once in any order, without any intervening characters."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Build `required` as a frequency map of `words`. Let `word_len` be the length of each word and `window_len = word_len * len(words)`.\n2. For each offset in `[0, word_len)`, use two pointers `left` and `right` that move in steps of `word_len`.\n3. Extract the word at `right`, update its count in `seen`, and increment a `matched` counter when the word count matches the requirement.\n4. While any word exceeds its required count, move `left` forward by `word_len`, decrementing counts and adjusting `matched`.\n5. When `matched` equals the number of distinct words and the window size equals `window_len`, record `left` as a valid start.\n6. Continue scanning all offsets."
