Slide `right` over `s`, adding characters to `window` counts and decrementing `required` when a needed count is met.\n3. When `required` reaches zero, attempt to shrink from the left, updating the best window when smaller substrings remain valid.\n4. Remove left characters from `window`, increasing `required` once a required count falls below target.\n5. Continue scanning to evaluate all possible windows."
