   "source": "## Solution Overview\nEmploy a sliding window with a hash map storing character frequencies. Expand the right edge while the window has at most two distinct characters; otherwise, move the left edge forward and decrement counts to restore validity."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Initialize `left = 0`, `best = 0`, and an empty dictionary `counts`.\n2. Iterate `right` over indices of `s`. For each character, increment its count in `counts`.\n3. While the dictionary contains more than two keys, move `left` forward, decrementing the count of the outgoing character and deleting it when the count hits zero.\n4. Update `best` with the current window length `right - left + 1`.\n5. Repeat until the end of the string and return `best`."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": "## Edge Cases & Pitfalls\n- Single-character strings trivially return 1.\n- Highly diverse strings force frequent shrinking but remain linear time.\n- Ensure characters are removed from the map when counts reach zero to avoid infinite loops."
