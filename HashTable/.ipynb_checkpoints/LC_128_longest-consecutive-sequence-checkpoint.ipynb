   "source": "## Detailed Explanation\n1. Load all numbers into a hash set for O(1) membership checks.\n2. For each number, determine whether it begins a sequence by checking if `num - 1` is absent.\n3. If it is a start, count forward while `current + 1` exists in the set, updating the best length found.\n4. Skip numbers that are not starts; their sequences have already been counted.\n5. Return the maximum length discovered."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": "## Follow-up Variants\n- Track the actual sequence elements rather than just its length.\n- Adapt to streams by maintaining a disjoint-set or interval map for dynamic updates.\n- Extend to detect near-consecutive runs with tolerances (e.g., gaps up to size k)."
