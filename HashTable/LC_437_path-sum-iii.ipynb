    "You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum. Return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum. The path does not need to start at the root or end at a leaf, but it must always move downward from parent nodes to child nodes.\n"

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Traverse the tree with DFS while keeping a running prefix sum. For every node we need the number of earlier prefixes whose value equals currentPrefix - targetSum. A hash map keyed by prefix sum counts gives us that answer in O(1). We increment the current prefix before exploring children and decrement after backtracking to keep the scope local to the active path.\n"

    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "We perform a depth-first traversal starting from the root. At each node we compute the running prefix sum along the path from the root to the current node. Any ancestor path that ends at this node contributes to the target if `prefixCurrent - targetSum` exists in the hash map of previously seen prefix sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize a hash map `prefix_count` with `{0: 1}` so paths that start at the current node are counted when prefix equals target.\n",
    "2. When visiting a node, add its value to the running sum.\n",
    "3. Increase the answer by `prefix_count[running_sum - targetSum]` because those prefixes complete a target path ending here.\n",
    "4. Increment `prefix_count[running_sum]` before exploring children, so descendants know this prefix exists.\n",
    "5. Recurse into left and right children.\n",
    "6. After returning, decrement `prefix_count[running_sum]` to remove the current node from the active path, preventing cross-branch contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures each node is processed once and the hash map mirrors the call stack state. It avoids enumerating all node pairs, reducing complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n"
